# USV-Analysis

These notebooks were used for gathering and analyzing ultrasonic vocalization (USV) data collected on mice. The vocalizations were recorded in lab and exported as .WAV files. These files were then analyzed by DeepSqueak for USV call detection and exported to Excel where each row represents a call and its attributes are listed along the columns. The 'Analysis' notebook sorts through the spreadsheets, appends call data generated by the lab such as stimulation frequency and sex, and stitches everything together into a dataframe ready for output or further analysis. The 'KMeans' notebook attempts to find clusters between sex based on call features.
